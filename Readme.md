# My Home Assistant config

This Repo contains my Home assistant configuration.  
Here I share all I use to run my HA setup, and all addon configs involved  
Its small in terms of connected devices but groing pretty fast, yes it is adictive hehe

i used to play with home automation in the late 90's being a electronics engineer by degree i loved to automate everything machines systems etc
I ended up programming and building everything myself, back in the day that was the best you could do, there were no projects like HA, hence there wasnt even simple wifi connected devices, everything was stand alone.

this hobby progressed slowly it was very time consuming to design and build, and when my profesional career realy started it al moved to the background.
but the last 10 years it started to come back, also i learned to really do some programmng (something else then pascal and assembly), learnig some PLC and C# allong web development using JS, then cloud came allong first very clicky , but soon more and more demand on extreme automation came, which i love!
so yes Home Automation became easier for me to understand programatically but the other thing that happend was the fact that building devices became more and more easy to use, the bar was lowered once again!  
Stuff like arduino really were game changers, more and more Makers jumped o nthe band wagon and created so much fun stuff, now ESP's rule the maker domain with even vendors comming with "intelligent" devices for the cheap (and hackable hehe) 

so tagging allong a few years i started using HA back in 2017 just for fun to learn, but not really in a live situation.
seeing the programm grow and becomming more reliable, I slowly introduced more  stuff into the home and exposing it to the family and they loved it!
So since 2018 it became a more prominent system, earlier this year we moved to a bigger house. for me the ideal moment to scrap everything and start freshhh

So here a my new steps in the world of Home Assistant, not reusing a single component and relearning some things a didtnt touch for a long time  
With the help of a great community inspiring me everyday, i'm sharing what i'm using so others can learn from my mistakes and give back to the community
